Internal app: QaS a lot of APIs THIRD PARTY, currenty not have standard how to implement in the application. Dont have way to monitor in the QaaS app, if the connc is still made, erros, if api key is expired, more insight if our apis connects are properly connect
ofthen is not the case, no idea is not running, later someone says data is not crrect , key expired
initial: get more insight into apis, have more standard (dashboard)
proof of concept: Sentinel 1 (recommend: N-Central)
data for sentinel 1 will be shown on the screen, graphs, \
sentinel 1 is fire scanner, how manythreads detected, get a screen like that, dont know if that needs to be standardized
api data has some members to it to connect to graph, based off things from the database
diif APIs, 
soap xml, rest json, (recommend: yaml)
standard for this, design, monitor, handle api keys, 
currently: google secret manager, some choices are already made, Flutter, back-end TypeScript, 
things I can research where 
best practices for building apis, maintaining it

test environment, cloud functions, back-end environemnt, own screen in the GCP, 

Sentinel 1
