We are currently utilizing Firebase and Flutter for most of our application development. 
However, we are intrigued to explore the potential of using the Azure cloud platform into our future projects.
We also have the problem that we do not have a default project which we can build up on when approaching a potential new customer. 
This default project could be a proof of concept in case Azure cloud platform is something for us. 
If not, this still could be made with Flutter and Firebase. By a default project we want something like 

•	A standardized login system with two-step authentication.
•	Predefined tables that can support potential customers in their work, including features like sorting columns, search functionality
, and data presentation.
•	Default user management, including user role management.
•	Page route management.
•	Standard responsive design.
•	A standardized method for importing third-party data using APIs.
•	A secure approach to storing API keys.
Additionally, it would be valuable to implement unit testing in this standard project and integrate it with Azure DevOps, 
which we have recently started using.
