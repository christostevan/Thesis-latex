\chapter{Evaluation and Reflection}
\section{Evaluation}

The assignment had a high level of complexity, as it utilizes many number of frameworks and tools, the infrastructure
analysis that has been done, the Design Patterns and software architectural pattern thought and created to solve
potential complex problems consisting of both new and existing functionalities, and ultimately the creation of test
strategy that would improve the quality of the delivered product.

\section{Reflection}
Before starting the graduation work placement project, I was excited to go back to \acrshort{qict} and particularly have the
same Company Supervisor who guided me for my previous work placement. This time I have asked \acrshort{qict} to give me with
an assignment that has more cybersecurity focus on it, and I was thrilled when they tasked me in integrating SentinelOne,
one of the most known cybersecurity platform, into their internal application.

Overall, I am very satisfied of what I have achieved, and proud of the final product that I have delivered to the company.
The task that I have done indeed bring much value to the company, as it will serve at least as a proof of concept if the company
wishes to further develop the integration. Even though that most of the technologies that I have used are not new to me, regarding
Flutter and Node.js, I still managed to have learned a lot, especially regarding Firebase features especially regarding Cloud functions
and Firestore \acrshort{db}, Algolia, SentinelOne \acrshort{rest} \acrshort{api} connection and its Vigilance feature, N-Central
\acrshort{api}s and how to synchronize data between 2 \acrshort{api}s, storing sessions in the backend, and the overall cybersecurity
and networking theoretical concepts.
