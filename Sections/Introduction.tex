    [\section{Project Background}]
    In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, cybersecurity remains a paramount concern for organizations
    across all industries. With the proliferation of sophisticated cyber threats and the increasing complexity of
    \acrshort{it} infrastructures, business are constantly seeking new and innovative ways to protect their digital
    assets and fortify their defences and safeguard sensitive data. In this pursuit, cybersecurity consultant firms
    have emerged as a critical ally for organizations, providing expert guidance and support in the development and
    implementation of robust cybersecurity strategies, playing a pivotal role in offering expertise and guidance to
    help organizations navigate the intricate realm of cybersecurity.

    One of the key strategies employed by cybersecurity consultants is the integration of third-party security
    \acrshort{api}s into their arsenal of tools and technologies. These \acrshort{api}s provide invaluable
    functionalities, ranging from vulnerability assessment and security scans to device health monitoring and
    threat intelligence analysis by \acrshort{ai}. By leveraging these \acrshort{api}s, cybersecurity consultants
    can enhance their capabilities and provide a more comprehensive and effective security solution to their
    clients, streamline their operations, provide clients with robust, proactive security measurers, and improve
    their overall service delivery.

    \acrshort{qict}, a small cybersecurity consultancy that the author is currently doing his graduation
    internship in,
    recognizes the critical importance of proactive \acrshort{api} monitoring in safeguarding its clients' digital
    assets. Their customers are small to medium-sized business with employees ranging from 1 to 100. \acrshort{qict} is
    therefore asked to monitor their clients' devices and ensuring the overall security of their systems, IT
    infrastructure, and digital assets. They typically engage in various activities, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Continuous Monitoring}: implementing tools and processes for continuous monitoring of
              clients' systems, devices, networks, and systems to detect and respond to security threats in
              real-time.
        \item \textbf{Vulnerability Assessment}: conducting regular vulnerability assessments and penetration
              testing to identify weaknesses in clients' systems and infrastructure
        \item \textbf{Incident Response}:
    \end{itemize}

    The company currently manages numerous third-party \acrshort{api}s for the above-mentioned purposes. Those
    \acrshort{api}s are the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
    \end{itemize}
    Currently, those \acrshort{api}s are managed manually and without a standardized implementation in their
    internal application, the \acrshort{qaas} app, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process.
