      \section{Research Topic}
      In a research, it is paramount to have the formulation of a clear research topic, research main question,
      and research sub-questions. The main question serves as the focal point around which the research revolves,
      encapsulating the primary objective or purpose of the study.
      The following main research question will be used throughout the research:
      \begin{center}
            \textit{"How can Quality ICT B.V. effectively enhance API monitoring within its internal application
                  while integrating and leveraging SentinelOne security threat platform for continuous
                  cybersecurity monitoring while still ensuring adherence to the highest security standards?"}
      \end{center}
      The research sub-questions are then used to function as a pathway that dissect the main
      question into smaller, more manageable components, which can then be addressed individually. This approach
      allows for a more comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the research topic, ensuring that all relevant
      aspects are covered and that the research is conducted in a systematic and organized manner.

                  photos or videos.
            \item Remote Config: allows developers to dynamically control and the change behaviour and appearance of their apps 
                  without publishing app updates and requiring users to download them. 
            \item Performance Monitoring
            \item Analytics: provides free and unlimited analytics solutions for understanding app usage, user engagement and 
                  user behaviour by tracking event logging, user demographics, and funnel analysis to gain valuable insights to 
                  improve the app.
            \item Crashlytics: is a lightweight, real-time crash and error reporter that helps developers track, prioritize, 
                  and fix stability issues that erode to the quality of the developer's app. 
            \item Test Lab: enables automated testing of the developer's app on real devices in the Google data center. 
            \item Dynamic Links: consist of deep links that dynamically route users to the content they are interested in, 
                  across platforms and devices. It helps developers create and share links that work the way they want, on the 
                  platform they want, and whether users have their apps installed. 
            \item \acrshort{ml} Kit: provides a set of \acrshort{ml} \acrshort{api}s that can be easily integrated developer's app.
