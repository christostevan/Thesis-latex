    In a research, it is paramount to have the formulation of a clear research topic, research main question, and research
    sub-questions. The main question serves as the focal point around which the researchr revolves, encapsulating the primary
    objective or purpose of the study. The research sub-questions are then used to function as a pathway that dissect
    The following main research question will be use throughout the research:
    \begin{center}
        \textit{"How can Q-ICT effectively enhance API monitoring within its internal application while integrating
            and leveraging SentinelOne security threat platform for continuous cybersecurity monitoring while
            still ensuring adherence to the highest security standards?"}
    \end{center}
    The research main question is then expanded in the following research sub-questions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is the current situation of the QaaS app of Q-ICT?
        \item How can SentinelOne can be integrated into the QaaS app environment, especially aligning with the
              \acrshort{api} monitoring functionality, while still utilizing their key features and capabilities in
              context of cyber threat detection and remote IT infrastructure management?
    \end{itemize}
    \section{Research Methodology}
    In this research, different research methods have been used to answer the research questions. This research will
    based on the six \acrshort{ict} research methods defined by HBO-I (\cite{ictresearchmethods}). A research method for
    each sub-question is then defined along with how the results are considered valid and reliable:
    \begin{itemize}[label=-]
        \item Sub-question \#1:
        \item Sub-question \#2:
        \item Sub-question \#3:
        \item Sub-question \#4:
    \end{itemize}
    \section{Research Question \#1: What is the Current Situation of the QaaS App of Q-ICT?}
    The \acrshort{qaas} app is a web application that is used by \acrshort{qict} .
