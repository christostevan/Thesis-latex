      \section{Research Topic}
      In a research, it is paramount to have the formulation of a clear research topic, research main question,
      and research sub-questions. The main question serves as the focal point around which the research revolves,
      encapsulating the primary objective or purpose of the study.
      The following main research question will be used throughout the research:
      \begin{center}
            \textit{"How can Q-ICT effectively enhance API monitoring within its internal application while
                  integrating and leveraging SentinelOne security threat platform for continuous cybersecurity
                  monitoring while still ensuring adherence to the highest security standards?"}
      \end{center}
      The research sub-questions are then used to function as a pathway that dissect the main
      question into smaller, more manageable components, which can then be addressed individually. This approach
      allows for a more comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the research topic, ensuring that all relevant
      aspects are covered and that the research is conducted in a systematic and organized manner.
      This research main question is therefore expanded in the following research sub-questions:
      \begin{itemize}
            \item What is the current situation of the \acrshort{qaas} app of \acrshort{qict}?
            \item What functionalities should be prioritized in the development of monitoring and managing
                  third-party \acrshort{api}s within an internal application while ensuring real-time monitoring,
                  error detection, and insight generation regarding \acrshort{api} connections?
            \item How can SentinelOne can be integrated into the QaaS app environment, especially aligning with the
                  \acrshort{api} monitoring functionality, while still utilizing their key features and capabilities in
                  context of cyber threat detection and remote IT infrastructure management?
            \item What are the most suitable visualization techniques for displaying the data processed and received by
                  the \acrshort{qaas} app in \acrshort{xml} and \acrshort{json} formats to ensure clear and
                  insightful representation of threats detected by SentinelOne and other relevant \acrshort{api}
                  connections?
      \end{itemize}
      \section{Research Methodology}
      In this research, different research methods have been used to answer the research questions. This research
      will be based on the six \acrshort{ict} research methods defined by HBO-I (\cite{ictresearchmethods}). A
      research method for each sub-question is then defined along with how the results are considered valid and
      reliable:

      \section{Research Question \#1}
      The \acrshort{qaas} app is a web application that is used by \acrshort{qict}. It is in Dart with Flutter as
      the front-end framework.

      \subsection{QaaS App Infrastructure}
      \textbf{Flutter}

      Flutter is an open-source framework made by Google in 2017. It used as a \acrshort{ui} toolkit for building
      natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop (Windows, mac\acrshort{os}, Linux) from a single
      codebase (\cite{flutter}).

      \textbf{Firebase}

      Firebase is a comprehensive platform for developing and managing web and mobile applications, created by
      Google and is party of \acrshort{gcp}. It was originally an independent company founded by Firebase, Inc.
      in 2011. It was then acquired by Google in 2014. Since then, it has become an integral part of Google's
      broader ecosystem of cloud services.

      Firebase is a \acrshort{baas} that provides developers with a variety of tools and services to help with both
      back-end infrastructure and front-end capabilities without worrying about managing servers or infrastructures.
      \begin{itemize}
            \item Firestore Database: Firestore is a NoSQL database that is part of the Firebase platform. It is a
                  flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development. It keeps data in sync across
                  client apps through real-time listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web, so the
                  developers can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet
                  connectivity.
            \item Authentication
            \item Functions
            \item Hosting
